This project is an escape room–based application where users solve cipher clues to progress, developed using Python with a graphical interface built using wxPython. To run the program, the user must install wxPython using `pip install wxPython`. This third-party module does not work on Google Colab, so the program must be executed locally using IDLE or any Python IDE.
